# 💼 Value Propositions – Kiptoo Collins

This document highlights a few key business problems I solve and the value I bring to finance and strategy teams.

## 1. 🔍 Problem: Poor Visibility into Financial Drivers

**Many teams struggle to understand what’s really driving profit, costs, or variance.**

✅ **What I Do:**  
- Build driver-based forecasts using Excel, SQL, or Power BI  
- Create dashboards that show the story behind the numbers  
- Translate financials into actionable insights for non-finance stakeholders  

💡 **Impact Example:**  
Helped a tech-enabled company spot margin compression early by modeling unit economics across customer segments.

## 2. 🧮 Problem: Slow or Inflexible Forecasting Processes

**Teams spend too much time on manual reporting and too little time on analysis.**

✅ **What I Do:**  
- Automate reporting and forecasting with dynamic Excel templates and Power Query  
- Set up rolling forecasts and scenario tools to improve agility  
- Design audit-proof models aligned to business structure  

💡 **Impact Example:**  
Reduced monthly reporting time by 60% for a client by converting static Excel packs into automated dashboards.

## 3. 💰 Problem: Investment Decisions Made Without Rigor

**Capital is allocated without clear ROI frameworks or sensitivity analysis.**

✅ **What I Do:**  
- Develop business cases and capital planning tools (e.g., CAPEX tracker, IRR models)  
- Create DCF and multiple-based valuations for investment assessments  
- Build LBO-style models for evaluating high-leverage decisions  

💡 **Impact Example:**  
Built a CAPEX prioritization model that flagged $700k in low-ROI projects for deferment.

## 4. 📉 Problem: Finance Isn’t Seen as a Strategic Partner

**Finance teams often present numbers, not insights.**

✅ **What I Do:**  
- Bridge the gap between numbers and strategy  
- Build finance tools aligned with exec-level decision-making  
- Tell data-backed stories that drive stakeholder buy-in  

💡 **Impact Example:**  
Helped a regional CFO reframe finance decks into strategy narratives that won project approvals.
